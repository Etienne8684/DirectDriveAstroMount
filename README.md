# DirectDriveAstroMount
Astronomical mounts are conventionally motorized by mechanically complex geared motor assemblies which always induce small positioning errors. These errors are periodic because they are repeated with each revolution of each pinion or of the worm of the reducer.

A much more interesting technology is that of the DirectDrive motor which can turn at very low speed such as 1 revolution per day, the speed of rotation of the starry-sky relative to the ground.

Unfortunately this technology is electronically quite complex. In addition, it also requires extremely precise knowledge of the position of the motor rotation axis and uses very expensive optical encoders for this.

This project consists of developing both an electronic motor control base + a precise but less expensive optical encoder system.

The principle is that the basis of this encoder is a non-regular system but perfectly stable over time: For example, a DVD on which a film is recorded: By reading the disc during its rotation, we obtain a detailed signal and not regular but perfectly linked to the rotational position of the disc.

If we teach the electronics of the mount to what exact position of the disc corresponds to the received signal, we get an accurate optical encoder for the price of a simple DVD.

My project is to create such electronics.
